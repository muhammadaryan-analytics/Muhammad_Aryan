<h2> Hey, I'm Aryan <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"> </h2>

I'm a **Data Analyst** specializing in **diagnostic analysis** and **business problem-solving**. I focus on answering "Why is this happening?" rather than just reporting what happened. My work distinguishes between operational issues (fixable through process improvements) and structural challenges (requiring strategic shifts).

I use **SQL**, **Python**, and **statistical testing** to diagnose root causes, validate hypotheses, and deliver recommendations grounded in business constraints—not just technical possibilities.

**Recent work:** Diagnosed why 97% of Olist marketplace customers never returned. Proved through statistical testing that the issue was structural market behavior, not operational failure. Recommended strategic pivot saving wasted retention spend and redirecting to acquisition efficiency.

## Currently Learning
- **Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Validation** (Chi-square, regression, A/B testing)
- **Predictive Analysis** (Moving from diagnostic to predictive models)
- **Prescriptive Analysis** (Optimization and recommendation systems)

## Featured Projects
- **[Olist Marketplace Retention Analysis](https://github.com/aryanlytics/Olist-Retention-Analysis)** - Diagnosed 97% churn using statistical tests to prove structural vs operational causes
- **[Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/aryanlytics/Instacart-Customer-Behavior-Analysis.git)** - to separate operational issues from customer behavior and timing patterns
